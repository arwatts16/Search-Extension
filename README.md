# Search-Extension
Search for known keywords against any configured data set and displays them on the page.

## Project Description
A Google Chrome Extension that highlights known entities on the current web page, given a particular data set, and allows follow on action. The action could be going to the page of the item or populating a new page with the available information.
This project will be developed as part of 2018 internship with Bit Systems (CACI) in Aurora, CO.
